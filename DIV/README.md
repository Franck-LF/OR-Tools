✅ — Google **OR-Tools** (Operations Research Tools) is extremely powerful and flexible. It’s designed to handle a wide range of **optimization** and **constraint programming** problems, across industries such as logistics, scheduling, manufacturing, and finance.

Below is a **comprehensive categorized list** of problem types you can solve with Google OR-Tools.

---

## 🧩 1. **Constraint Programming (CP-SAT Solver)**

Google’s **CP-SAT solver** is state-of-the-art and can model both **combinatorial** and **mixed integer** problems.

You can solve problems like:

### Scheduling & Planning

* Job shop scheduling
* Flow shop scheduling
* Employee/workforce rostering
* School timetabling
* Meeting or class scheduling
* Machine assignment & sequencing
* Task allocation with precedence constraints
* Project planning with dependencies (PERT/CPM)

### Resource Allocation

* Resource-constrained project scheduling (RCPSP)
* Multi-resource assignment (machines, people, tools)
* Shift planning with skills or constraints
* Nurse or driver scheduling

### Logical / Combinatorial Problems

* Sudoku or n-Queens puzzles
* Cryptarithmetic puzzles (like SEND+MORE=MONEY)
* Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and MaxSAT
* Graph coloring
* Set covering / set partitioning problems

### Custom Constraint Satisfaction

* Arbitrary constraints between variables (equality, inequalities, linear expressions, reified conditions)
* All-different, element, circuit, no-overlap, cumulative, table constraints, etc.

* Blending problems (mixing raw materials to meet targets)
* Portfolio optimization (finance)
* Diet problem / resource minimization
* Transportation and assignment problems
* Cutting stock problem
* Network flow problems (shortest path, min-cost flow)

You can use backends like:

* SCIP (open-source MIP solver)
* CBC (open-source MIP solver)
* GLOP (Google’s LP solver)
* SAT solver for integer problems
